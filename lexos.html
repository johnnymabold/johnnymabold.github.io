    Lexos Test. Jane Austen completed her first book, Northanger Abbey, in 1803, however it would not be published until after her death in 1817. The book is often considered a parody of Gothic fiction and was highly inspired by the writings of the prominent Gothic author, Ann Radcliffe, whose book The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794) is referenced throughout Northanger Abbey. Since travel writing is a topic of personal interest, I have elected to use <a href="http://voyant-tools.org/">Voyant</a> to compare the texts of Austen and Radcliffe to examine the appearance of general word frequencies as well as links to words that involve travel writing. I have selected the following key words: letter, journal, journey, travel, write. </p>
   
<h2>Northanger Abbey and The Mysteries of Udolpho</h2>

  <p>
  The following is a figure representing the most popular words that appear in the selected works of Austen and Radcliffe. In general, it comes as no surprise that the names of characters are highly prevalent within the visualization. Adam Hammond, in Literature in the Digital Age, conducted a similar word cloud involving Austen’s Pride and Prejudice and, as in my own example, he took note that there was an overwhelming appearance of the female character’s first names, while the popular names of the male characters were their surnames. For example, in the visualization below, you see Catherine and Emily in comparison to Tilney and Thorpe. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The following is an interactive representation of links to the words of frequency. Below, you can enter the key words: letter, journal, journey, travel, and write, to see which words are closely connected. (I have already engaged the stopwords tool to remove the words: said, mr, mrs, miss, chapter, and count).
  </p>
  
      <p>
   The following is yet another way to examine the relative frequencies of the key words found in the texts by Austen and Radcliffe. Note the key word trends that are color-coded and appear across the top of the chart. Here, it should also come as no surprise for the Austen reader to see that her use of the word letter far exceeds that of Radcliffe. 
  </p>
  
    
  <h2>Selected Travel Writers</h2>

  <p>
<ul>
<li>James Boswell, The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson, 1768</li>
<li>Daniel Defoe, A Tour Thro’ the Whole Island of Great Britain</li>
<li>Henry Fielding, Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon, 1755</li>
<li>Tobias Smollett, Travels through France and Italy, 1766</li>
<li>Laurence Sterne, A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy, 1768</li>  
</ul>
  </p>
  
    <p>
Overall, looking to both the general and specific word frequencies found in the works of Austen and Radcliffe have brought about a few points of consideration. The first being the general appearance of women’s first names, and men’s surnames. Second, the specific terms serve to remind us that travel in the time was both tiresome and dangerous as the words “fatigue” and “accident” were linked to “journey”. Upon reviewing a corpus taken from contemporary writers of travel, a revelation occurred. The word “dr” was seen to connect to “journal,” thereby inspiring me to direct my future research to examine a convergence of travel writing and the narratives of traveling physicians.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Voyant is an amazing tool, although I must admit that I was un able to establish connections that furthered a connection between travel and medicine. I took the time to broaden the corpus of travel writing by more than four times the original size in hope of being able to use other voyant tools that would span from the connections. Although this was not possible, looking to travel and medicine has been a new found interest and I hope to continue to task to find deeper connections. In conclusion, I would be interested to more deeply explore the pieces that I have uploaded and look forward to the addition of more open source travel texts to analyze in different ways.
