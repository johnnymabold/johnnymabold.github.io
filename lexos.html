Overall, looking to both the general and specific word frequencies found in the works of Austen and Radcliffe have brought about a few points of consideration. The first being the general appearance of women’s first names, and men’s surnames. Second, the specific terms serve to remind us that travel in the time was both tiresome and dangerous as the words “fatigue” and “accident” were linked to “journey”. Upon reviewing a corpus taken from contemporary writers of travel, a revelation occurred. The word “dr” was seen to connect to “journal,” thereby inspiring me to direct my future research to examine a convergence of travel writing and the narratives of traveling physicians.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Voyant is an amazing tool, although I must admit that I was un able to establish connections that furthered a connection between travel and medicine. I took the time to broaden the corpus of travel writing by more than four times the original size in hope of being able to use other voyant tools that would span from the connections. Although this was not possible, looking to travel and medicine has been a new found interest and I hope to continue to task to find deeper connections. In conclusion, I would be interested to more deeply explore the pieces that I have uploaded and look forward to the addition of more open source travel texts to analyze in different ways.
